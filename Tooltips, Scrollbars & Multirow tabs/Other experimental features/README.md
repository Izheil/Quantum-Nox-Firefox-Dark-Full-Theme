<h2>Other experimental features</h2>
<p>Here go any other experimental feature  that isn't the main focus of the theme and their description. You shouldn't really need to install these unless you want some very specific function.</p>
<p>There are probably better alternatives out there, so you should only use these if you really couldn't find it anywhere else (since, as mentioned, these are experimental)</p>

<h3>Bookmarks-toggle.uc.js</h3>
<p>Toggles visibility of the bookmarks toolbar when pressing F2 (you can change which keys in the file). You'll need to add this rule to your userchrome:</p>
<pre>#PersonalToolbar {visibility: collapse !important}</pre>
