# Alternative Scrollbars and tooltips

### If you only want scrollbars, or the tooltips, you need to patch firefox with either the [patcher](https://github.com/Izheil/Quantum-Nox-Firefox-Dark-Full-Theme/releases), or following the manual method detailed in [JS Loader](https://github.com/Izheil/Quantum-Nox-Firefox-Dark-Full-Theme/tree/master/Multirow%20and%20other%20functions/JS%20Loader) to enable it.
  
## Installation

Replace the `scrollbars.as.css` or `tooltips.as.css` you had from the dark theme (or create the `userChrome.css` file mentioned above) for any of the ones inside the "alternative scrollbars" or "alternative tooltips" style folders. Make sure to also have patched firefox with the method detailed at the start of this readme.

If you have done everything right, you should see the different styled scrollbars or tooltips next time you open firefox (or after you restart it).
